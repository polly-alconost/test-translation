Running was never something I’d considered doing.
Back when I was a child in St Louis, Missouri, it wasn’t an activity considered to be suitable for girls.
But while sitting around a table at a Christian conference on the Oregon coast in the late 1970s, a visiting priest was extolling the virtues of hotfooting around.
“You can get high from it,” he said, which got my attention.
I asked him: “Shouldn’t our highs come from prayer?
I am a nun, after all.”
Maya Angelou’s childhood was one of poverty and abuse — but she rose.
She became a dancer, singer, actor, writer, poet, journalist, civil rights activist, and a university professor — always giving a voice to the African-American experience.
A high point in her career was reading one of her poems, “On the Pulse of Morning,” at the inauguration of President Clinton in 1993.
