There is a text for translation.
Running was never something I’d considered doing.
Back when I was a child in St Louis, Missouri, it wasn’t an activity considered to be suitable for girls.
But while sitting around a table at a Christian conference on the Oregon coast in the late 1970s, a visiting priest was extolling the virtues of hotfooting around.
“You can get high from it,” he said, which got my attention.
I asked him: “Shouldn’t our highs come from prayer?
I am a nun, after all.”
